# ESP32 AI Sketch Generator and Uploader

A Python-based tool that uses AI to generate Arduino sketches for ESP32 and uploads them directly to your device. This tool allows you to describe your desired ESP32 functionality in plain English and automatically generates and uploads the corresponding code.

## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered Arduino sketch generation
- 🔍 Automatic ESP32 port detection
- 💾 Local sketch storage for future reference
- 📤 Direct upload to ESP32
- 🔄 Interactive command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- ESP32 development board
- USB cable
- OpenAI API key
- Arduino CLI installed and configured

### Required Hardware

- ESP32 development board (any variant)
- USB-to-Serial converter (usually built into the development board)
- USB cable compatible with your board

### Required Software

- Python packages:
  - pyserial
  - esptool
  - openai
- Arduino CLI
- ESP32 board support package for Arduino

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd esp32-ai-uploader
```

2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install pyserial esptool openai
```

3. Install Arduino CLI following the official instructions
4. Configure Arduino CLI for ESP32:
```bash
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```

5. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Usage
1. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB

2. Run the script:
```bash
python esp32_ai_uploader.py
```
3. When prompted, enter a description of what you want your ESP32 to do. For example:
   Enter your prompt (or 'quit' to exit): Create a blinking LED program that blinks every 500ms
   
4. The tool will:
   The tool will:

Generate the appropriate Arduino sketch using AI

Save it to the esp32_sketches directory

Offer to upload it to your device
