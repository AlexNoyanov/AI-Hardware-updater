# ESP32 AI Sketch Generator and Uploader

A Python-based tool that uses AI to generate Arduino sketches for ESP32 and uploads them directly to your device. This tool allows you to describe your desired ESP32 functionality in plain English and automatically generates and uploads the corresponding code.

## Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered Arduino sketch generation
- üîç Automatic ESP32 port detection
- üíæ Local sketch storage for future reference
- üì§ Direct upload to ESP32
- üîÑ Interactive command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- ESP32 development board
- USB cable
- OpenAI API key
- Arduino CLI installed and configured

### Required Hardware

- ESP32 development board (any variant)
- USB-to-Serial converter (usually built into the development board)
- USB cable compatible with your board

### Required Software

- Python packages:
  - pyserial
  - esptool
  - openai
- Arduino CLI
- ESP32 board support package for Arduino

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd esp32-ai-uploader
```

2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install pyserial esptool openai
```

3. Install Arduino CLI following the official instructions
4. Configure Arduino CLI for ESP32:
```bash
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```

5. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Usage
1. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB

2. Run the script:
```bash
python esp32_ai_uploader.py
```
3. When prompted, enter a description of what you want your ESP32 to do. For example:
   Enter your prompt (or 'quit' to exit): Create a blinking LED program that blinks every 500ms
   
4. The tool will:
   The tool will:

Generate the appropriate Arduino sketch using AI

Save it to the esp32_sketches directory

Offer to upload it to your device

# DeepSeek AI-Uploader Tool
This tool automatically generates ESP32 code from natural language prompts using DeepSeek's API and uploads it directly to your connected ESP32 board.

## Features

- Converts plain English prompts to working ESP32 code
- Automatic compilation and upload to connected ESP32
- Secure API key management (never stored in code)
- Supports both Arduino IDE and ESP-IDF workflows

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- ESP32 connected via USB
- [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/installation/) installed
- DeepSeek API key (get it from [DeepSeek's platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/))

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-auto-coder.git
   cd esp32-auto-coder
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv requests
   ```

3. Install Arduino CLI and ESP32 support:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | sh
   arduino-cli core update-index
   arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
   ```

4. Create your environment file:
   ```bash
   echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual DeepSeek API key.

## Usage

1. Connect your ESP32 board via USB
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python esp32_auto_upload.py
   ```
3. When prompted, enter what you want your ESP32 to do in plain English
   Example prompts:
   - "Make an LED blink every second"
   - "Read temperature from DHT11 sensor and print to serial"
   - "Create a WiFi access point called 'MyESP32'"

4. The script will:
   - Generate the appropriate code
   - Display it for your review
   - Compile and upload to your board automatically

## Configuration

You can customize these settings by editing the `.env` file:

- `PORT`: Set your serial port (e.g., `COM3` on Windows or `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux)
- `DEFAULT_MODEL`: Change the DeepSeek model if needed

Example `.env`:
```
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk_yourkeyhere
PORT=COM3
DEFAULT_MODEL=deepseek-coder
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Upload fails with port errors
- **Solution**: Check your port name in Device Manager (Windows) or `ls /dev/tty*` (Linux/Mac)

**Problem**: API requests fail
- **Solution**: Verify your API key and internet connection

**Problem**: Compilation errors
- **Solution**: The generated code might need adjustments. Copy the code and modify it manually if needed.

## Security Note

Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore` for your protection.
